\chapter{Final Thoughts}

In the last 20 years, the number of internet users has increased hundred-fold. Now over half of the world population uses it on a daily basis and a large part of that growth is attributed to the availability of basically all documented knowledge in the past several decades. The size of the internet is estimated to be in the thousands of terabytes; with all this data floating around, the most effective way to find what you want is through the use of search engines. The most popular, Google, receives almost 6 billion search queries each day, and text classification plays a big role in processing them. Text categorization techniques are used to classify news stories, to find interesting information, and to guide a user?s search. Historically, search engine technology and text classification techniques have grown hand in hand. Text classification isn?t just limited to search engines, it also has applications in many other areas such as spam filtering and language identification. By exploring text classification, we can develop a fundamental understanding in the inner workings of the world?s most useful tool. We hope to have taught you interesting and insightful information in this section. We?d now like to guide you through the construction of a simple search engine where you?ll apply what you?ve learned!
