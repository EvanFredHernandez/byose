\chapter{Final Thoughts}

Internet usage has exploded over the past 20 years. More than half the world's population depends on the Internet for quick access to reliable information. We can attribute much of this growth and dependence to the availability of search engines and more generally to the advancement of text mining. Indeed, the Internet sits atop a mountain of information, thousands of terabytes in magnitude. With all this data floating around, scientists and ordinary people alike need the ability to extract relevant information from natural language text in real time. Document categorization offers just one technique for doing so.

In general, text mining and natural language processing are growing fields. Language is difficult to master even for human adults, and in many ways language is a complete mystery to computers. Filled with ambiguity and loose structure at every corner, language is akin to an ever-morphing labyrinth. As such, text mining faces many open questions, some of which already have patchwork solutions while others appear to be more or less out of the question for the foreseeable future. Regardless, text mining, natural language processing, and information science are exciting fields of research. We hope you agree after completing this lesson.
